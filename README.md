Linux

To install Android Studio on Linux, proceed as follows:

   - Unpack the .zip file you downloaded to an appropriate location for your applications, such as within /usr/local/ for your user profile, or /opt/ for shared users.

   - If you're using a 64-bit version of Linux, make sure you first install the required libraries for 64-bit machines.
  -  To launch Android Studio, open a terminal, navigate to the android-studio/bin/ directory, and execute studio.sh.
  -  Select whether you want to import previous Android Studio settings or not, then click OK.
  -  The Android Studio Setup Wizard guides you through the rest of the setup, which includes downloading Android SDK components that are required for development.
